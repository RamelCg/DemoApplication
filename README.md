# DemoApplication

Description: Implement a grid collection view, for example 3x3. Each cell has UILabel (or UITextView) inside.   Requirements: *Cells can be pinched, e.g. be expanded or squeezed by two fingers.
*The proper grid should be maintained, for example one cell can’t have larger width than other cells in the same column and can’t have larger height than cells in the same row. Let’s say if you expand a cell in the 2nd row and the 2nd column then other cells in that column and row get their frames changed by width or by height. 
 Note:  We expect to see a clean and good structured code, writen with SOLID principles. Also 80% of test coverage should be achieved. 
Here is some sample how UI can look like, the cell of 2nd row and 2nd column is expanded:
